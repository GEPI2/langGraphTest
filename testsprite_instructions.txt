  - Expected: Error message preventing duplicate.

### Fine-tuning Dashboard
- **[ ] TC010: Job Creation**
  - Action: Create job with valid dataset.
  - Expected: Job created with 'Pending' status.
- **[ ] TC011: Status Monitoring**
  - Action: Monitor running job.
  - Expected: Status updates (Pending -> Running -> Completed/Failed).

## 2. Backend Test Cases (API & Logic)

- **[ ] TC_BE_001: Graph Execution API**
  - Endpoint: `POST /graph/execute`
  - Verify: Correct execution of defined nodes.
- **[ ] TC_BE_003: RAG Upload API**
  - Endpoint: `POST /rag/upload`
  - Verify: File accepted, chunked, and stored in ChromaDB.
- **[ ] TC_BE_005: MCP Registration API**
  - Endpoint: `POST /mcp/servers`
  - Verify: Server config stored correctly.
- **[ ] TC_BE_007: Fine-tuning Job API**
  - Endpoint: `POST /finetune/jobs`
  - Verify: Job ID returned; Background task started.
- **[ ] TC_BE_010: Error Handling**
  - Verify: Invalid inputs return 400/422 errors, not 500 crashes.

## 3. Integration & System
- **[ ] TC014: Frontend-Backend CORS**
  - Verify: No CORS errors during API calls from browser (port 80 -> 8001).
