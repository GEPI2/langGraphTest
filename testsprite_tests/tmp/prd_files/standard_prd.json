  "product_overview": "Dynamic LangGraph Builder is an interactive platform that allows users to visually design, execute, and manage AI agents through a comprehensive graph editor and supporting dashboards. It integrates a React-based frontend with a FastAPI backend to provide seamless handling of LangGraph agents, knowledge base management, server connections, and model fine-tuning workflows.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Enable users to visually create and manage complex AI agent workflows using a drag-and-drop graph editor.",
    "Provide robust backend services supporting Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Model Connector Protocol (MCP) server management, and fine-tuning jobs.",
    "Ensure smooth integration between frontend UI and backend API services, facilitating real-time graph execution and data management.",
    "Allow users to upload and test knowledge bases and tools within dashboards.",
    "Support scalability and maintainability through modular architecture using modern technologies like FastAPI, React, and LangChain."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Graph Editor with visual node creation, drag-and-drop functionality, and real-time connection management using React Flow.",
    "RAG Dashboard for uploading documents, managing knowledge bases, and testing retrieval capabilities.",
    "MCP Dashboard to register and manage MCP server connections and browse available AI tools.",
    "Fine-tuning Dashboard for creating, monitoring, and managing fine-tuning jobs on AI models.",
    "FastAPI Backend API exposing endpoints for all core services including graph execution, fine-tuning job management, RAG processing, and MCP server configuration."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User accesses the Graph Editor, drags nodes from the sidebar, connects them to form an AI agent workflow, and runs the graph to execute the pipeline.",
    "Users navigate to the RAG Dashboard to upload documents to the knowledge base and test information retrieval from those documents.",
    "In the MCP Dashboard, users register new MCP server connections and view available AI tools for integration.",
    "Through the Fine-tuning Dashboard, users create new fine-tuning jobs, submit training data, and monitor job statuses until completion.",
    "Frontend interacts with backend APIs to save graph configurations, execute nodes, manage fine-tuning jobs, and handle RAG document processing.",
    "System validates all user inputs and provides appropriate feedback and status updates throughout the workflows."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Graph Editor must support node drag-and-drop, connection creation, and successful execution trigger verified by backend calls.",
    "Backend services for fine-tuning, RAG, and MCP APIs must respond correctly to create, upload, register, and list requests with appropriate statuses.",
    "All dashboards must allow data input and provide real-time feedback on operations such as job creation, document upload, and server registration.",
    "Frontend and backend must integrate seamlessly with successful CORS communication and no errors on Docker startup.",
    "Graph saving should persist configurations accurately and re-load correctly on reopening.",
    "System must handle invalid user inputs gracefully with error messages and prevent faulty states."
